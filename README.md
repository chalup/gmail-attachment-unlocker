Gmail Attachment Unlocker
=========================

This application registers as a generic GMail attachment handler, which unlocks the 'Save' action for all attachments, which in turn provides additional information about the attachment for other installed applications, which, finally, may let the user view the attachment instead of "No app can open this attachment for viewing." message.
